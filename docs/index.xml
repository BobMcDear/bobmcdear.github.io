      <description>About Me I am a machine learning developer with specialties covering software development in Python, C/C++, and Swift, data science, machine learning, and deep learning (including related packages such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and ONNX), computer vision, mathematics, and cloud services.
In the past, I have implemented machine learning methods for myriad different tasks, some unseen in academia or industry, and have devised solutions for challenging problems involving too little data, hardware constraints, data drift, interpretablity requirements, et cetera, making me proficient in traditional as well as cutting-edge machine learning branches such as computer vision, self-supervised learning, neural architecture search, Bayesian models, embedded machine learning, and more.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, popular attention mechanisms in computer vision will be examined and implemented in PyTorch.
Particularly, each module&amp;rsquo;s methodology is analyzed, with detailed descriptions, visualizations, and code, plus optional mathematical explanations
for those preferring more formal descriptions. Results on ImageNet are also included.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
