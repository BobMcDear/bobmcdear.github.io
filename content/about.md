# About Me

I am a software developer with a proven track record of delivering complex projects across multiple domains. My areas of expertise cover Python, C/C++, SQL, and Swift, data science and management, machine and deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and more. Challenging problems I have tackled in the past include but are not limited to collecting data and developing computer vision models for off-road visual understanding, implementing self-supervised learning techniques to manage data scarcity, employing Bayesian and tree-based models for interpretable personalized healthcare, and deploying machine learning models on a variety of devices under hardware constraints. My work has had a substantial impact on improving the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the aforementioned applications, in addition to some being the first of their kind in academia or industry.
