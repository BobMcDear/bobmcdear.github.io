# About Me

I am a machine learning developer with specialties covering software development in Python, C/C++, and Swift, data science, machine learning, and deep learning (including related packages such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and ONNX), computer vision, mathematics, and cloud services.

In the past, I have implemented machine learning methods for myriad different tasks, some unseen in academia or industry, and have devised solutions for challenging problems involving too little data, hardware constraints, data drift, interpretablity requirements, et cetera, making me proficient in traditional as well as cutting-edge machine learning branches such as computer vision, self-supervised learning, neural architecture search, Bayesian models, embedded machine learning, and more. 

Currently, I am pursuing opportunities that would enable me to utilize machine learning for immediate real-world applications. Research areas I am keen about encompass multi-modal learning, foundation models, and physics-based deep learning.
